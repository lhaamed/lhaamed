- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lhaamed, I have learned Laravel since 2016 and now I'm able to develop medium-scale applications using this powerful framework. it's 2 years that I've been learning angular as a JS front-end framework. there is much to learn for me in this new world. My arms are open to new challenges in programming and development approaches.
